# Downloader is a python tool that uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

- It merely wraps commands that are executed by yt-dlp, as such if one wants a feature rich tool then please head over to the [yt-dlp repository](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and follow instructions there on how to download and install the tool for your benefit.
- With that said, to run this tool you will need to install yt-dlp
